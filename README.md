# Kura

Kura is a cutting-edge real-time messaging platform built with a robust tech stack to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. The frontend is developed using React, providing a dynamic and intuitive interface, while SCSS is used for styling to maintain a visually appealing design. State management is handled by Redux, ensuring data consistency and efficient user interaction. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express, delivering high performance and scalability. Mongoose, in conjunction with MongoDB, manages the database operations, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing user data and message histories. Real-time communication is facilitated by Socket.IO, enabling instant messaging and live updates, making Kura a reliable and efficient communication tool.
